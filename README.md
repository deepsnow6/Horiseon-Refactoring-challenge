## Project description

This is a refactored codebase for a static website belonging to Horiseon, which serves to promote digital marketing solutions. The original HTML and CSS code was functional but wasn't optimized for accessibility and efficiency purposes. I refactored the code with the purpose of eliminating these issues while also maintaining the original appearance and functionality of the original website.

Motivation:
The main motivation for this project was to practice and improve my CSS and HTML skills by creating a professional and accessible website. This project provided real-world experience because refactoring code is a common task for web developers and is essential to write accessible and efficient code.

Problems Solved:
The original code had several accessibility issues such as improper HTML semantic structure, and redundant CSS code. After fixing the semantic structure of the HTML, the CSS had be be altered to remain functional and then consolidated. By refactoring the code, these issues were addressed, making sure the code met accessibility standards and it was left cleaner then the original mockup.

What I Learned:
I was able to gain experience refactoring and consolidating HTML and CSS, code in order to maximize both efficiency and accessibility with the goal of  maintaining the visual appearance and functionality of the orignial website.
